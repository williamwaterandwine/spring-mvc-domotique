Today, home automation is increasingly present in our daily lives, it moved everywhere in our homes. 
The purpose of this project was to develop a client of automation application that allowed with Arduinos to communicate to multiple actuators or sensors. The client communicates with the server via a REST Server with JSON trames to capture or modify the signals on the pins of Arduinos cards. 
In addition, with the explosion of the sector of smartphones and tablets, they have become the "remote control" to do everything when connected to the Internet. Thus, the client is optimized for different screen sizes, it is Responsive Web Design.
